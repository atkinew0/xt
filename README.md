This is a terminal in browser using xterm.js which connects to a node.js backend running a real terminal on your local machine, wrapped in react to monitor and help with command recognition and memorization

To run:

in /src directory run two commands:
"node server"   - to start node.js backend
"npm start"     - to start react app which then hits backend api route and spawns new terminal
